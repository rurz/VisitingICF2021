**Description**: Working repository for the 2021 Research Fellowship at the Institute of Physical Science of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (ICF-UNAM)

**Period**: April-August, 2021

**Programming language disclaimer**: This repository is developed as a package in the Julia language to serve as a core for the explaining notebooks inside.

**Content**:

**1.  Unitary rotation of polychromatic (multichannel) images using quaternions**

**2. Unitary and arbitrary rotation of 3D images (voxels) using Moshinsky coupling coefficients**

**Repository structure**:

- Root
  - *src/* : Main module and scripts with the core functions
  - *docs/* : Documentation, who are PDF's describing the project, the project logs and reports
  - *notebooks/* : Interactive notebooks who serve as  self-explaining documents for the results achived. Jupyter notebooks  (.ipynb) and Pluto.jl notebooks (.jl) are available

(Note: Because we have notebooks, there is a chance to try it directly, without any installation, at a MyBinder.org server)
